# Flexible-Random-Early-Detection
RED(Random Early Detection) is a classic algorithm to ease congestion and then to improve the quality of service of the network.When average queue size is near to the minimum and maximum threshold, the loss rate is unreasonable. To improve the performance of linear approach of RED, a nonlinear approach is proposed .
